# self-opening-box
When covid hit, I came up with the idea of a no-contact, self-opening box. I used the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensor to create a circuit, which would cue the motor to rotate if an body was detected within 25 centimetres. Once the circuit was perfect, I asked my mother for a big plastic box and installed it, attaching the servo motor to the lid. As soon as I completed my model, I put it into implementation. Keeping it outside my house with the sign 'Put the package here!'.
